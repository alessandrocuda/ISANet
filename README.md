ISANet library provides a flexible and modular neural network library. It was entirely developed in Python using Numpy as a package for scientific computation. This library has been developed during the following projects at [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.unipi.it/en/) of [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english):

  - <a href="https://github.com/alessandrocuda/ML_Project_19_20">ML_Project_19_20</a>: developed during the machine learning (ML) course held by Professor Alessio Micheli. The aims were to implement an ML model simulator (Neural Network, SVM, ...), understand the hyper-parameters effect on the model and solve a supervised regression learning task by using your own library and the CUP dataset provided in the course. 
   - <a href="https://github.com/alessandrocuda/CM_Project_19_20">CM_Project_19_20</a>: developed during the Computational Mathematics for learning and data analysis course held by Professor Antonio Frangioni and Professor Federico Poloni. The aims were to extend ISANet lib in order to include the NCG FR/PR/HS and beta+ variants, and the L-BFGS methods (as new optimizer) and study the objective function used during the learning phase and study it from a mathematical and optimisation point of view.


ISANet is composed of low (Keras-like) and high-level (Scikit-learn-like) APIs divided into modules. The idea is to provide an easy but powerfull implementation of a Neural Network library to allow everyone to understand it from the theory to practice. More importat, the library leave open any kind of future work: extend to [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), CNN layer or optimizer, and so on. In addition the library provides some datasets and a module for model selection (Grid Search and Cross Validation API).

NOTE: ISANet only support SGD, NCG and LBFGS with (Mean Square Error + regularization) as LOSS function in the gradient computation.

## Usage
This code requires Python 3.5 or later, to download the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/alessandrocuda/ISANet`

Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system:

```
cd ISANet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

An example with the **low level api (keras-like)**:

```python
# ...
from isanet.model import Mlp
from isanet.optimizer import SGD, EarlyStopping
from isanet.datasets.monk import load_monk
import numpy as np

X_train, Y_train = load_monk("1", "train")
X_test, Y_test = load_monk("1", "test")

#create the model
model = Mlp()
# Specify the range for the weights and lambda for regularization
# Of course can be different for each layer
kernel_initializer = 0.003 
kernel_regularizer = 0.001

# Add many layers with different number of units
model.add(4, input= 17, kernel_initializer, kernel_regularizer)
model.add(1, kernel_initializer, kernel_regularizer)

es = EarlyStopping(0.00009, 20) # eps_GL and s_UP

#fix which optimizer you want to use in the learning phase
model.setOptimizer(
    SGD(lr = 0.83,          # learning rate
        momentum = 0.9,     # alpha for the momentum
        nesterov = True,    # Specify if you want to use Nesterov
        sigma = None        # sigma for the Acc. Nesterov
    ))

#start the learning phase
model.fit(X_train,
          Y_train, 
          epochs=600, 
          #batch_size=31,
          validation_data = [X_test, Y_test],
          es = es,
          verbose=0) 
            
# after trained the model the prediction operation can be
# perform with the predict method
outputNet = model.predict(X_test)
```

what's next? look to [USE_CASES.md](https://github.com/alessandrocuda/ISANet/blob/master/examples/USE_CASES.md) for more example with the **High-Level API (Scikit-learn-like)** and the **Model Selection API**. Instead, [here](https://github.com/alessandrocuda/ISANet/blob/master/examples/README.md) you can find some example scripts.


## TODO
- [ ] Separate bias from the weight matrix for more clarity.
- [ ] Extend with JAX for GPU support.
